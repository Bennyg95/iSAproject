    In this project we will be designing our own instruction set architecture. 
    
#### Instructions

###Editing text file
    
    In order to start writing the code to test this program you will need to edit the .txt file.
    
    In order to run the program you need to run the following command:
        
        python isAProject.py

Initializing a variable:

    * all variables must be created at the begining of the file
    
    * Initializing an integer variable:
        Dec var = 3
    
    * Initializing a string:
        Str var = "fallas"
        


User Input:

    * INPUT value

Stop the program
    
    HALT

Creating a function:

    func nameFunction(
    
    )


Operations:
    
    Adding two numbers:
        ADD num1 num2   // will replace anything in the accumulator to the output value
        
    Subtracting two numbers:
        SUBT    num1 num2 // will replace anything in the accumulator to the output value
    
    Mulpliplying two numbers:
        MULT    num1 num2   // will replace anything in the accumulator to the ouput value
    
    Dividing two numbers:
        DIV num1 num2   // will replace anything in the accumulator to the output value
